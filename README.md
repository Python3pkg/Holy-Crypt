Holy-Crypt
===========

A holy encryption method to protect your strings and assets from the eyes of the blasphemes government and their demon pawns 

##How does it work?
Leave RSA Behind

A random string with a maximum limit of 255 characters is generated from a random verse of the King James Bible. Each character offers up to 1 billion years of holy protection that cannot be broken by the demons at the NSA or the United States Goverment. With these elite tatics you will be able to protect all of your messages and assets from unholy eyes. 

Here is an example output


```python

Message: 'I must protect America from the demons at the NSA'
Key: 'einattynuynsemJ|mehEee,shaihydae\nirnr|oor~~ntSodnsfty\ntn|ftnmhardvtnyyp|pyIaettaielSepeunyerlvEr~Epusve:uoetyro7sduosghoottepttoem7uydtvtoyerhyehtdtm|tnrhy5lps2ahni,onituyygSrrponau~isefd5sysietrIednhry'
Encrypted: '+\x06XSde\x16[de_UE^j:WGW+ECLVWMS\x05jIC\x02nK\\Z]l\x0cMc\x1boSVs:4,'
Decrypted: 'I must protect America from the demons at the NSA'
```

An example of usage is included within the holy_crypt.py it is well documented and easy to understand

##Why Did I Make This?
This was made in response to Paypals ludicrious claim that you need "goverment approval" to encrpyt your own stuff, that and the fact that even just looking up anything about encrpytion or Linux can have you end up on a watch list. What a time to be alive.
